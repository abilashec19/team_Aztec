Nowadays, technology has developed to a greater extent, makes life easier. At the same time, the negative side of it also developed to an enormous extend. There is considerable confusion among the people in finding out the real and the fake. In our project, a system has been developed that identifies the authentic and fake people of the Police Department. The authenticated information of people of the Police Department is stored in the database, and anyone can access that by providing proper identification.  This prevents the fake people pretend as police who try to rob money from the people. Our Originality Detector app components are Activities Services, Broadcast receivers and Content providers. A content provider manages a shared set of app data that can store in the file system. In this application, the identity of the police person is taken.  Convert the data set as a database that will be stored in the cloud for global access through the Originality Detector application.
